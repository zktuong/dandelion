Hi there! I have put together a python package for analyzing single cell BCR/TCR data from 10x Genomics 5' solution! It streamlines the pre-processing, leveraging some tools from immcantation suite, and integrates with scanpy/anndata for single-cell BCR/TCR analysis. It also includes a couple of functions for visualization.

## Citation
`dandelion` is now published at [***Nature Biotechnology***](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-023-01734-7)!

Please cite the following if you use version 0.3.0 onwards:

The data used in the Nature Biotechnology paper is available at a separate [repository](https://github.com/zktuong/dandelion-demo-files/tree/master/dandelion_manuscript).

This repository also includes a Git submodule for the dandelion_manuscript folder, which is stored in the dandelion-demo-files repository (click link above that says `dandelion_manuscript`)

## Overview

Please refer to the [documentation](https://sc-dandelion.readthedocs.io/).

The raw files for the examples can be downloaded from 10X's Single Cell Immune Profiling datasets [website](https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-vdj/datasets).

## Installation

### Singularity container

`dandelion` now comes ready in the form of a singularity container:
```bash
singularity pull library://kt16/default/sc-dandelion:latest
singularity shell --writable-tmpfs -B $PWD sc-dandelion_latest.sif
```
This will load up a container that has all the required dependencies installed.

This can be used for the preprocessing steps by navigating to the data folder and use:
```bash
singularity run -B $PWD sc-dandelion_latest.sif dandelion-preprocess
```

If you have multiple samples to process, it is reccomended to specify the `--meta` option with a `.csv` file detailing the samples:
```bash
singularity run -B $PWD sc-dandelion_latest.sif dandelion-preprocess --meta meta.csv
```

### Python package

Start off by creating a conda environment containing scanpy, following [official scanpy instructions](https://scanpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html). Once done, run the following:

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge graph-tool
pip install sc-dandelion
```

Between this and the pipelines within the singularity container, you should be covered for most of your needs.


### Manual Full Installation

I understand that the singularity container may not be for everyone, so here is a more detailed installation guide for those who want to install the package manually. The instructions may vary depending on your system, so please adjust accordingly. The easiest way is to still to just use the singularity container for the preprocessing steps.

```bash
# install igblast and blast
conda install -c bioconda igblast blast # if this doesn't work, download them manually
# https://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/blast/executables/igblast/release/LATEST/
# https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/executables/blast+/LATEST/
# Set the paths to them appropriately
echo 'export PATH=path/to/igblast/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bash_profile
echo 'export PATH=path/to/blast+/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bash_profile
```

You will need to download the database folder in this repository and place them somewhere accessible. There are [scripts](https://github.com/zktuong/dandelion/tree/master/container/scripts) in the `container` folder that will help you download the imgt/ogrdb databases and you can use them like this:

```bash
python prepare_imgt_database.py
python prepare_ogrdb_database.py
```

Also set the paths to the germline and igblast databases
```bash
echo 'export GERMLINE=path/to/database/germlines/' >> ~/.bash_profile
echo 'export IGDATA=path/to/database/igblast/' >> ~/.bash_profile
echo 'export BLASTDB=path/to/database/blast/' >> ~/.bash_profile
source ~/.bash_profile
```

For some of the pre-processing steps, you will need to install `rpy2` and some R packages. The easiest way to do this is to install them all via conda:

```bash
# in bash/zsh terminal
conda install -c conda-forge rpy2 r-optparse r-alakazam r-tigger r-airr r-shazam
```

Otherwise, you can also use `pip` to install `rpy2` and then install the R packages manually:
```bash
pip install rpy2
# If it fails because it's compiling using clang, first, work out where the path is to your gcc compiler (use brew to install gcc if needed):
# then run
# env CC=/path/to/location/of/bin/gcc-9 pip install rpy2
# Use pip to install the following with --no-cache-dir --upgrade if necessary
```
```R
# in R
install.packages(c("optparse", "alakazam", "tigger", "airr", "shazam"))
```
and then lastly install dandelion:
```bash
pip install sc-dandelion
# or
pip install git+https://github.com/zktuong/dandelion.git
# or  installing from a specific branch
pip install git+https://github.com/zktuong/dandelion@branch_name
```
