Hi there! I have put together a python package for analyzing single cell BCR/V(D)J data from 10x Genomics 5' solution! It streamlines the pre-processing, leveraging some tools from immcantation suite, and integrates with scanpy/anndata for single-cell BCR analysis. It also includes a couple of functions for visualization.

## Overview

Illustration of the `Dandelion` class slots

![](docs/notebooks/img/dandelion_class.png)

Please refer to the [documentation](https://sc-dandelion.readthedocs.io/) or the notebooks [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/zktuong/dandelion/tree/latest/docs/notebooks/):

The raw files for the examples can be downloaded from 10X's Single Cell Immune Profiling datasets [website](https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-vdj/datasets).

## Installation

### Singularity container

`dandelion` now comes ready in the form of a singularity container:
```bash
singularity pull library://kt16/default/sc-dandelion:latest
singularity shell --writable-tmpfs -B $PWD sc-dandelion_latest.sif
```
This will load up a conda-environment that has all the required dependencies installed.
This can be used for the preprocessing steps by navigating to the data folder and use:
```bash
singularity run -B $PWD sc-dandelion_latest.sif dandelion-preprocess
```
Please refer to the [documentation](https://sc-dandelion.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/singularity_preprocessing.html) for more information.

For more fine control, as well as for the exploration steps, please install via following the instructions below.

### Manual
I would reccomend installing this in order:
```bash
# in bash/zsh terminal
# create a conda environment with specific modules
conda create --name dandelion python=3.7 # or 3.8, 3.9
conda activate dandelion
```

#### python/conda
```bash
# Install scanpy https://scanpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html
conda install seaborn scikit-learn statsmodels numba pytables
conda install -c conda-forge python-igraph leidenalg
pip install scanpy

# skip if doing pre-processing via container
conda install -c bioconda igblast blast # if this doesn't work, download them manually (see below)

# optional: installing rpy2 (if not doing pre-processing)
# This is optional because it's only used for interaction with some of the R packages from the immcantation suite. Skip if prefer keeping it simple and run the different tools separately
# if you just want to stick with the base R
pip install "rpy2>=3.4" # or if you don't mind having conda manage R: conda install -c conda-forge "rpy2>=3.4"
# make sure not to use the same R package folder or you will end up with major issues later.

# Use pip to install the following with --no-cache-dir --upgrade if necessary
# and then lastly install this
pip install sc-dandelion
# or pip install git+https://github.com/zktuong/dandelion.git
# for the development branch, run this: pip install git+https://github.com/zktuong/dandelion.git@devel
````

#### R
If doing pre-preprocessing, `dandelion` requires some R packages intalled.
```R
# in R
install.packages(c("optparse", "alakazam", "tigger", "airr", "shazam"))
```
or the following if using conda to manage R:
```bash
# in bash/zsh terminal
conda install -c conda-forge r-optparse r-alakazam r-tigger r-airr r-shazam
```

The package should now be properly installed and when starting up jupyter notebook in the virtual environment, the kernel `python3` should work. Otherwise, you might need to add it manually:
```bash
# in bash/zsh terminal
python -m ipykernel install --user --name dandelion --display-name "Python (dandelion)"
```

## Required database
Last but not least, you will need to download the [database folder](https://github.com/zktuong/dandelion/tree/master/container) in this repository and place them somewhere accessible. The igblast and germline database folders were originally downloaded from [immcantation](https://immcantation.readthedocs.io/) docker image (4.2.0). The blast database were downloaded from IMGT and manually curated. I have uploaded a copy of the required databases in a separate [repository](https://github.com/zktuong/databases_for_vdj) (Last update: 01/08/2021). Once you've unpacked the folders, export the the path to the database folders as environmental variables in your `~/.bash_profile` or `~/.zshenv` like below. This will allow dandelion to access them easily. In the future, the databases will have to be updated accordingly.

So for example, if I unpack into `~/Documents`
```bash
# in bash/zsh terminal
# set up environmental variables in ~/.bash_profile
echo 'export GERMLINE=~/Documents/dandelion/database/germlines/' >> ~/.bash_profile # or ~/.zshenv
echo 'export IGDATA=~/Documents/dandelion/database/igblast/' >> ~/.bash_profile # or ~/.zshenv
echo 'export BLASTDB=~/Documents/dandelion/database/blast/' >> ~/.bash_profile # or ~/.zshenv
source ~/.bash_profile # or ~/.zshenv
```
see https://github.com/zktuong/dandelion/issues/66 for a known issue if you are using a notebook via jupyterhub.

This is already available in the singularity container under `/share/database/`.

## External softwares
While blast and igblast executables are managed through conda, you can also download [igblast](https://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/blast/executables/igblast/release/LATEST/) and [blast+](https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/executables/blast+/LATEST/) manually, and store the softwares somewhere accessible. Just make sure to set the paths to them appropriately.
```bash
# in bash/zsh terminal
# unpack where relevant and export the path to the softwares, e.g. ~/Documents/
echo 'export PATH=~/Documents/software/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bash_profile # or ~/.zshenv
source ~/.bash_profile # or ~/.zshenv
```

This is already available in the singularity container under `/share/`.
