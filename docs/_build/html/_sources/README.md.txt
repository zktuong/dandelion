Hi there! I have put together a python package for analyzing single cell BCR/V(D)J data from 10x Genomics 5' solution! It streamlines the pre-processing, leveraging some tools from immcantation suite, and integrates with scanpy/anndata for single-cell BCR analysis. It also includes a couple of functions for visualization. 


## Overview

Please refer to the [documentation](https://sc-dandelion.readthedocs.io/) or the notebooks [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/zktuong/dandelion/tree/master/docs/notebooks/):

The raw files for the examples can be downloaded from 10X's Single Cell Immune Profiling datasets [website](https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-vdj/datasets).

## Installation

### Singularity container

`dandelion` now comes ready in the form of a singularity container:
```bash
singularity pull library://kt16/default/sc-dandelion:latest
singularity shell sc-dandelion_latest.sif
```
This will load up a conda-environment that has all the required dependencies installed.
This can be used for the preprocessing steps by navigating to the data folder and use:
```bash
singularity run -B $PWD sc-dandelion_latest.sif dandelion-preprocess
```
Please refer to the [tutorial](https://sc-dandelion.readthedocs.io/en/master/notebooks/singularity_preprocessing.html) for more information.

For more fine control, as well as for the exploration steps, please install via following the instructions below.

### Manual
I would reccomend installing this in order:
```bash
# in bash/zsh terminal
# create a conda environment with specific modules
conda create --name dandelion python=3.7 # or 3.8, 3.9
conda activate dandelion
```

#### python/conda
```bash
# Install scanpy https://scanpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html
conda install seaborn scikit-learn statsmodels numba pytables
conda install -c conda-forge python-igraph leidenalg
pip install scanpy

# skip if doing pre-processing via container
conda install -c bioconda igblast blast # if this doesn't work, download them manually (see below)

# optional: installing rpy2 (if not doing pre-processing)
# This is optional because it's only used for interaction with some of the R packages from the immcantation suite. Skip if prefer keeping it simple and run the different tools separately
# if you just want to stick with the base R
pip install "rpy2>=3.4" # or if you don't mind having conda manage R: conda install -c conda-forge "rpy2>=3.4"
# make sure not to use the same R package folder or you will end up with major issues later.

# Use pip to install the following with --no-cache-dir --upgrade if necessary
# and then lastly install this
pip install sc-dandelion
# or pip install git+https://github.com/zktuong/dandelion.git
# for the development branch, run this: pip install git+https://github.com/zktuong/dandelion.git@devel
````

#### R
If doing pre-preprocessing, `dandelion` requires some R packages intalled.
```R
# in R
install.packages(c("optparse", "alakazam", "tigger", "airr", "shazam"))
```
or the following if using conda to manage R:
```bash
# in bash/zsh terminal
conda install -c conda-forge r-optparse r-alakazam r-tigger r-airr r-shazam
```

The package should now be properly installed and when starting up jupyter notebook in the virtual environment, the kernel `python3` should work. Otherwise, you might need to add it manually:
```bash
# in bash/zsh terminal
python -m ipykernel install --user --name dandelion --display-name "Python (dandelion)"
```

## Required database
Last but not least, you will need to download the database folder in this repository and place them somewhere accessible. The igblast and germline database folders were originally downloaded with [immcantation's](https://immcantation.readthedocs.io/en/4.1.0/docker/intro.html) docker image (4.1.0). The blast database were downloaded from IMGT and manually curated. I have uploaded a copy of the required databases in a separate [repository](https://github.com/zktuong/databases_for_vdj) (Last update: 28/11/2020). Once you've unpacked the folders, export the the path to the database folders as environmental variables in your `~/.bash_profile` or `~/.zshenv` like below. This will allow dandelion to access them easily. In the future, the databases will have to be updated accordingly.

So for example, if I unpack into `~/Documents`
```bash
# in bash/zsh terminal
# set up environmental variables in ~/.bash_profile
echo 'export GERMLINE=~/Documents/dandelion/database/germlines/' >> ~/.bash_profile # or ~/.zshenv
echo 'export IGDATA=~/Documents/dandelion/database/igblast/' >> ~/.bash_profile # or ~/.zshenv
echo 'export BLASTDB=~/Documents/dandelion/database/blast/' >> ~/.bash_profile # or ~/.zshenv
source ~/.bash_profile # or ~/.zshenv
```
see https://github.com/zktuong/dandelion/issues/66 for a known issue if you are using a notebook via jupyterhub.

This is already available in the singularity container under `/share/database/`.

## External softwares
While blast and igblast executables are managed through conda, you can also download [igblast](https://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/blast/executables/igblast/release/LATEST/) and [blast+](https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/executables/blast+/LATEST/) manually, and store the softwares somewhere accessible. Just make sure to set the paths to them appropriately.
```bash
# in bash/zsh terminal
# unpack where relevant and export the path to the softwares, e.g. ~/Documents/
echo 'export PATH=~/Documents/software/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bash_profile # or ~/.zshenv
source ~/.bash_profile # or ~/.zshenv
```

This is already available in the singularity container under `/share/`.
